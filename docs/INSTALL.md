# Installing BTCRecover #

There are a few basic steps to installing BTCRecover.

1) Download and unzip the BTCRecover script

2) Download and install Python3

3) Install required packages via Python PIP

4) (Optional) Install PyOpenCL module for GPU Acceleration

5) Test your installation (Optional, but a good idea)

These steps are also covered in Videos below for each supported Operating System.

**Note: Depending on your operating system and python environment, you may need to replace the `python` command with `python3`. (By default, the command to use will be `python` in Windows and `python3` in Linux) Most non-technical users are on Windows, so all example commands will use `python` to match the defaults for this platform**

## 1) Downloading *btcrecover* ##

Just download the latest version from <https://github.com/3rdIteration/btcrecover/archive/master.zip> and unzip it to a location of your choice. There’s no installation procedure for *btcrecover* itself, however there are additional requirements below depending on your operating system and the wallet type you’re trying to recover.

You can also use Git (If you have it installed) to do this with the command `git clone https://github.com/3rdIteration/btcrecover/`


## 2) Install Python ##

**Note:** Only Python 3.10 and later are officially supported... BTCRecover is automatically tested with all supported Python versions (3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, 3.14) on all supported environments (Windows, Linux, Mac), so you can be sure that both BTCRecover and all required packages will work correctly. Some features of BTCRecover may work on earlier versions of Python, your best bet is to use run-all-tests.py to see what works and what doesn't...

**Recommended Python version: 3.13.** On Python 3.10–3.13, `coincurve`
ships pre-built wheels, so the default `pip install -r requirements.txt`
"just works" with the fastest secp256k1 backend. Python 3.14 (and any future
3.15) currently has **no** `coincurve` wheel, so the default install cannot use
coincurve there — see [Python 3.14 and coincurve](#python-314-and-coincurve).
If you are on 3.14/3.15, install `wallycore` (or rely on the pure-Python
fallback) and expect the HD-wallet packages in `requirements-full.txt` to be
unavailable until coincurve publishes a wheel for that version.

### Windows ###
Video Demo of Installing BTCRecover in Windows: <https://youtu.be/JveLyJqEgLk>

Install Python via the Windows Store.

**Note for Large Multi-CPU Systems:** Windows limits the number of possible threads to 64. If your system has more logical/physical cores than this, your best bet is to run the tool in Linux. (Ubuntu is an easy place to start)

### Linux ###
Video Demo of Installing BTCRecover in Ubuntu Live USB: <https://youtu.be/Met3NbxcZTU>

Most modern distributions include Python 3 pre-installed. Older Linux distributions will include Python2, so you will need to install python3.

If you are using SeedRecover, you will also need to install tkinter (python3-tk) if you want to use the default GUI popups for seedrecover. (Command line use will work find without this package)

Some distributions of Linux will bundle this with Python3, but for others like Ubuntu, you will need to manually install the tkinter module.

You can install this with the command: `sudo apt install python3-tk`

If any of the "pip3" commands below fail, you may also need to install PIP via the command: `sudo apt install python3-pip`

If your installation fails to build cffi, you may also need to install libffi-dev with the command: `sudo apt install libffi-dev`

If you get a message that there is no installation candidate for Python3-pip, you will need to enable the "universe" repository with the command: `sudo add-apt-repository universe`

You can then re-run the command to install python3-pip from above.

### Android via Termux ###
Some warnings and notes...

* Termux support remains experimental, but automated tests now run weekly via the Termux Docker container on GitHub Actions
  
* Your phone may not have sufficient cooling to run BTCRecover for any meaninful length of time
  
* Performance will also vary dramatically between phones and Android versions... (Though it is actually fast enough to be useful for simple recoveries)
  
* Termux is not a standard Linux environment and is not officially supported, but might work following the process below... (And if it doesn't, just use a PC instead...)
  
* Install Termux following the instructions here: <https://termux.dev/en/> (Currently not officially distributed on Google Play and the version on Google Play is not currently up-to-date)

You will then need to install Python as well as some other packages (Mostly the Coincurve build requirements)

    pkg install python-pip git autoconf automake build-essential libtool pkg-config llvm lld rust libsodium

  The `python-pip` package already includes PIP. Attempting to upgrade it with
  `pip install --upgrade pip` will fail and is unnecessary.

Once this is done, you can install the base requirements for BTCRecover that allow recovery of common wallet types. (The full requirements have a lot of packages and will take a long time to build, like 15-20 minutes or more...)

If you want to install the full requirements (requirements-full.txt), some packages like `py-sr25519-bindings` and `cryptography` use maturin as their build backend. The pre-built maturin wheel does not work correctly on Termux, so you need to build maturin from source first and install the affected packages without build isolation:

    export ANDROID_API_LEVEL=24
    export SODIUM_INSTALL=system
    pip install maturin --no-binary maturin
    pip install py-sr25519-bindings==0.2.3 --no-build-isolation
    pip install -r requirements-full.txt

#### Termux and the secp256k1 backends

**coincurve does not work on Termux/aarch64 at all.** Even when it builds from
source, `import coincurve` fails at runtime with
`ImportError: dlopen failed: cannot locate symbol "_Py_NoneStruct"`
(see [ofek/coincurve#189](https://github.com/ofek/coincurve/issues/189)). The
`wallycore` package also has no Android/aarch64 wheel and its source build fails.
As a result, the only secp256k1 backend that works on Termux is the bundled
**pure-Python** implementation — which is correct but around 100× slower for
public-key derivation (see [secp256k1 Backends](#secp256k1-backends-coincurve--wallycore--pure-python)).

Two practical consequences:

 * Install the **base** `requirements.txt` only (or install `wallycore` and
   `protobuf`/`pycryptodome` individually). Avoid `requirements-full.txt` on
   Termux: its `bip-utils` package hard-requires `coincurve`, which cannot be
   installed on aarch64, so the full requirements will fail to install there.
 * Expect recoveries on a phone to be slow; this is a CPU/backend limitation,
   not a misconfiguration.

#### Enabling Native RIPEMD160 Support
As of OpenSSL v3 (Late 2021), ripemd160 is no longer enabled by default in some Linux environments and is now part of the "Legacy" set of hash functions. In Linux/MacOS environments, the hashlib module in Python relies on OpenSSL for ripemd160, so if you want full performance in these environments, you may need modify your OpenSSL settings to enable the legacy provider.

You can check if this is required by running `python check_ripemd160.py`

As of July 2022, BTCRecover does include a "pure Python" implementation of RIPEMD160, but this only offers about 1/3 of the performance when compared to a native implementation via hashlib.

Video Demo of this applying fix can be found here: <https://youtu.be/S3DWKp0i4i0>

An example of the modified configuration file can be found here: <https://github.com/3rdIteration/btcrecover/blob/master/docs/example_openssl.cnf>

For more information, see the relevant issue on the OpenSSL Github repository: <https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/16994>

### MacOS ###

Video Demo of Installing BTCRecover in MacOS: <https://youtu.be/PMxkf4VYnkk>

MacOS doesn't ship with Python3 and if you run Python3 on a stock install, will install the dev tools and a very old version of Python3... Rather than use that, we will use a current version of Python installed via Brew.

1) [Install brew via instructions at brew.sh](https://brew.sh)
   
The Install command is:  

    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

**Then after that has completed, follow the "next steps" instructions too.**

    source ~/.zshrc
   
2) [Install Coincurve and Wallycore build requirements](https://ofek.dev/coincurve/install/) 
   
The Install command is:

    brew install autoconf automake libffi libtool pkg-config python python-tk swig gsed

3) Install Rust (Optional, but needed for requirements-full modules)

The Install command is:

    curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh

**If you install rust, close the current terminal window and open a new one before continuing with the process.**

## 3) Install requirements via Python Pip ##

Once both Python3 and PIP have been installed, you can install the requirements for BTCRecover.

### Essential Requirements
You will first want to install the basic packages required for BTCRecover with the command:

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

This will give you the functionality needed recovery of Bitcoin/Ethereum wallets (And clones of these chains)

If when run this command, you get an error message similar to **error: externally-managed-environment** then you need to add an additional argument `--break-system-packages` to the above command. (So the command will be `pip3 install -r requirements.txt --break-system-packages`) 

Note: If you use Python for other things beyond BTCRecover, then the `--break-system-packages` could cause other issues, but in such situations, managing your python virtual environments for your specific system is beyond the scope of this documentation.

#### Python 3.14 and coincurve

**coincurve does not currently ship pre-built wheels for Python 3.14**, and
building it from source currently fails for both available releases:

 * **coincurve 21** fails with `RuntimeError: Expected exactly one LICENSE file in cffi distribution, got 0`.
 * **coincurve 20** fails with `ERROR: Use build.verbose instead of cmake.verbose for scikit-build-core >= 0.10`.

Pre-built wheels exist only up to Python 3.13 (coincurve 21) / 3.12 (coincurve 20)
on Windows, macOS, and Linux, so most desktop users on Python 3.10–3.13 are
unaffected. If you are on **Python 3.14** (or any platform without a pre-built
wheel), coincurve cannot be installed at all right now.

Because BTCRecover now uses a pluggable secp256k1 backend, this is not fatal:
if you install **wallycore** (`pip3 install wallycore`, already part of
`requirements-full.txt` and the base `requirements.txt`), BTCRecover will
automatically use it instead of coincurve and run at full C-accelerated speed.
If neither coincurve nor wallycore can be installed, BTCRecover falls back to
the bundled pure-Python implementation (with a startup warning) — correct, but
around 100× slower for public-key derivation. You can force a backend with the
`BTCR_BACKEND` environment variable (see
[secp256k1 Backends](#secp256k1-backends-coincurve--wallycore--pure-python)).

**Caveat for `requirements-full.txt` on Python 3.14:** the HD-wallet packages
`bip-utils` (and the packages that depend on it — `py_crypto_hd_wallet`,
`slip10`, `stellar_sdk`) hard-require `coincurve`, which cannot be installed on
3.14. So `pip install -r requirements-full.txt` will fail on Python 3.14. The
base `requirements.txt` does not have this problem (it only needs `wallycore`
plus `protobuf`/`pycryptodome`), so install that and add the coincurve-dependent
HD-wallet extras only once a coincurve wheel exists for 3.14.

### Packages for Extended Wallet Support
Depending on your wallet type, you may also want to install the packages required for full wallet support. This is a much larger download and may also require that you install additional software on your PC for these packages to build and install.

`pip3 install -r requirements-full.txt`

Note, if you are on MacOS, if this installation fails, you will also need to export the python path.

    export PYTHON=/opt/homebrew/bin/python3

### Installing individual packages
If you are an advanced user, you may choose to install only those additional packages that are required for the specific recovery you are attempting. More information about which wallets require which packages is at the bottom of this guide.*

## 4) Install PyOpenCL for GPU Acceleration ##

GPU Support will require additional OpenCL libraries to be installed that aren't covered by the above commands... 

For more information and instructions, [see the GPU acceleration page here](./GPU_Acceleration.md)

## 5) Testing your Installation ##

Once you have downloaded and unzipped BTCRecover, installed Python and all required libraries, you can test the program with the command:

`python run-all-tests.py -vv`

This command will take a few minutes to run and should complete without errors, indicating that your system is ready to use all features of BTCRecover.

## Wallet Python Package Requirements ##

### scrypt

BTCRecover prefers the `wallycore` implementation of `scrypt` when available.
If `wallycore` is not installed it falls back to `pylibscrypt`, which is
approximately 20% slower for BIP38 operations and other wallet formats that rely
on scrypt.

----------

### secp256k1 Backends (coincurve / wallycore / pure-Python)

BTCRecover no longer hard-depends on `coincurve` for secp256k1 operations
(public-key derivation, P2TR taproot tweaking, and Electrum 2.8 ECIES). It
selects a backend automatically, in this order:

 1. **coincurve** — Used when the `coincurve` package is installed (this is the
    default when you install `requirements.txt` or `requirements-full.txt`).
 2. **wallycore** — Used when `coincurve` is *not* installed but `wallycore`
    is. `wallycore` is already a dependency of `requirements-full.txt` and is
    also usable with the base requirements by installing it separately
    (`pip install wallycore`). It covers every secp256k1 operation BTCRecover
    needs, at roughly the same speed as `coincurve` (see Performance below).
 3. **pure-Python** — Used only when neither `coincurve` nor `wallycore` is
    available. A warning is printed on startup. This keeps BTCRecover working in
    minimal environments (e.g. Termux, or platforms without pre-built C
    extension wheels), but it is dramatically slower for secp256k1-heavy
    recoveries.

You can force a specific backend (for testing, or to avoid an unwanted
dependency) by setting the `BTCR_BACKEND` environment variable to `coincurve`,
`wallycore`, or `purepython` before running BTCRecover. If the forced backend is
not available, BTCRecover warns and falls back to the next available one — so
setting `BTCR_BACKEND` is not by itself proof of which backend ran. To check
what is actually in use:

    python -c "from btcrecover import crypto_backends; print(crypto_backends.BACKEND_NAME)"

`benchmark.py --backend NAME` makes this check for you, and aborts rather than
reporting results labelled with a backend that did not actually run.

#### Performance

**`coincurve` and `wallycore` perform roughly the same on most systems.** Both
wrap a C implementation of secp256k1, so the gap between them is typically within
run-to-run noise. Pick whichever installs cleanly on your platform (see the
Python 3.14 and Termux notes above) rather than choosing one for speed.

Both are **well over 100× faster** than the pure-Python backend at public-key
derivation, which is what dominates a standard BIP-39 wallet recovery. Indicative
single-threaded figures (AMD Ryzen 9 9950X, Python 3.13) — absolute numbers vary
widely with hardware, so the ratios are the point:

| Backend            | Public-key derivations/sec | Electrum 2.8 ECIES mult/sec | Relative speed |
|--------------------|---------------------------:|----------------------------:|---------------:|
| coincurve          | ~70,000                    | ~31,000                     | ~1× (baseline) |
| wallycore          | ~71,000                    | ~31,000                     | ~1×            |
| pure-Python        | ~600                       | ~530                        | ~115× slower   |

The pure-Python backend is perfectly usable for small
jobs and for verifying dependencies aren't required, but for large password or
seed searches you should install `coincurve` or `wallycore` to avoid runtimes
that are two orders of magnitude longer.

For **simple recoveries** — 1–2 missing or wrong BIP-39 words (e.g. a wrong
word from a known wallet, or one word you don't fully remember) — the
pure-Python backend is fast enough: on an average computer the search finishes
in **well under 24 hours** without any additional modules installed. You can
start with just Python + the base `requirements.txt` and only bother with the
C-backed packages if your recovery turns out to be more complex.

You can compare the backends on your own hardware with
`python benchmark_crypto_backends.py`, which reports each operation separately
for every backend you have installed.

### PyCryptoDome ###

With the exception of Ethereum wallets, PyCryptoDome is not strictly required for any wallet, however it offers a 20x speed improvement for wallets that tag it as recommended in the list above.

### Py_Crypto_HD_Wallet ###

This module is required for a number of different wallet types.

For Windows Users, you will also need to install the Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools befor you will be able to successfully install the module. 

A video tutorial that covers this can be found here: <https://youtu.be/0LMUf0R9Pi4>

For MacOS and Linux users, the module should build/install just fine if you follow the installation instructions on this page for your platform.

### Staking-Deposit ###

This module isn't available as a pre-compiled package and must be downloaded and built from source.

It is installed as part of the collection of modules installed by `requirements-full.txt`.

Alternately, you can attempt to download, build and install it via pip3 with the following command:
   
`pip3 install git+https://github.com/ethereum/staking-deposit-cli.git@v2.5.0`

This module also requires the `py_ecc` module which can be installed with the command:

`pip3 install py_ecc`

[More information can be found at its repository](https://github.com/ethereum/staking-deposit-cli/)

Note: Some dependencies for this module won't always build if you are running the latest version of Python, if you run into build errors, you should try the previous major Python Versions until you find one that works on your system (eg: Something like 3.10)
